  title     = {Microscopic modelling of simultaneous two-phase precipitation: application
               to carbide precipitation in low-carbon steels},
  abstract  = {A thermodynamically-based precipitation model, employing the classical
               nucleation and growth theories, has been adapted to deal with simultaneous
               precipitation of metastable and stable phases. This model gives an
               estimation of the precipitation kinetics (time evolution of radius and
               density of precipitates for both phases, as well as the evolution of solute
               fraction) in a wide range of temperature. Results were successfully
               compared with an experimental isothermal precipitation diagram
               (Time–Temperature-Transformation, {TTT}) from the literature for the
               precipitation of ϵ carbide and Fe3C in low-carbon steels.},
