  title     = {Precipitation evolution in an Al-Zn-Mg alloy during non-isothermal heat
               treatments and in the heat-affected zone of welded joints},
  abstract  = {Welding of Al-Zn-Mg alloys is increasingly used in the transportation
               industry. The
optimisation of the welding process requires a good
               understanding of the microstructures
generated by the rapid temperature
               rise in the heat-affected zone.
This study deals with the evolution of the
               precipitation state after welding of the 7108.50
alloy in different initial
               tempers. A quantitative characterisation of the hardening precipitates
in
               the heat-affected zone has been carried out by {SAXS}, {TEM} and {DSC} just
               after welding and
after different post-welding heat treatments. To better
               understand the mechanisms involved in
the precipitation evolution during
               this highly non-isothermal thermal cycle, controlled heat
treatments,
               including reversion and continuous heating, have been studied.
Modelling
               based on the evolution of a particle distribution has been developed in
               order to
predict the precipitation state after various heat treatments,
               including welding.},
