  abstract =      {Controversy about the magnetic properties of
                   alpha(double prime)-Fe16N2 thin films makes it
                   desirable to examine bulk material. In the original
                   preparation and crystal structure determination of
                   alpha(double prime) in 1951, N-austenite (gamma)
                   prepared by nitriding alpha-iron powder at 700-750 C
                   was quenched to give N-martensite (alpha') which then
                   gave alpha + alpha(double prime) on long tempering at
                   120 C. The final product was a mixture of either
                   alpha + alpha(double prime) or alpha + alpha(double
                   prime) + gamma with less than 50\% alpha(double
                   prime). Recent repetitions of this preparative method
                   in three different laboratories have given mixtures
                   with varying amounts of alpha(double prime), again
                   never greater than 50\%, and with magnetic moments of
                   alpha(double prime) -- assessed from measurements
                   made on the mixtures -- that show considerable
                   variation. Studies of alpha' tempering by x ray
                   diffractometer ({XRD}), and of alpha(double prime)
                   precipitation from supersaturated N ferrite (alpha)
                   by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
                   ({TEM}), both show that slow ordering of N atoms to
                   produce alpha(double prime) occurs only after
                   localized regions of alpha' and alpha reach the Fe8N
                   composition by a clustering process. Thus, apha'-Fe8N
                   can be obtained with a tetragonality c/a equal to
                   that of alpha(double prime), but without the complete
                   N ordering that is characteristic of Fe16N2. This
                   might explain some of the variability in magnetic
                   properties. The inhibiting effect of oxygen and other
                   impurities on the nitriding of iron is emphasized,
                   the existence of the alpha(double prime)-carbonitride
                   Fe16(C,N)2 is noted, and possible methods for 100\%
                   production of bulk alpha(double prime) are
                   suggested.},

  abstract =      {The precipitation of nitrogen during isothermal aging
                   between 100 and 300°C in a quenched Fe-0.022 wt\%N
                   alloy was studied by means of electrical resistance
                   measurement. The precipitation of α″- and
                   γ′-phases and the transition from α″- to
                   γ′-phase were elucidated by optical and
                   transmission electron microscopy. The alloy was made
                   by nitrogenizing molten iron with nitrogen gas.The
                   nucleation of α″-phase is completed on
                   dislocations and in ferrite matrix during quenching
                   or the very early period of aging at below 225°C.
                   The precipitation of nitrogen proceeds by a gradual
                   growth of α″-disks whose number decreases
                   monotonously with aging time. The rate controlling
                   process of the precipitation is considered to be the
                   diffusion of single nitrogen atoms.The nucleation of
                   γ′-phase is completed before appreciable growth of
                   the γ′-phase during aging at above 200°C. The
                   rate of growth of γ′-phase is controlled by the
                   diffusion of single nitrogen atoms as considered in
                   the case of the α″-phase precipitation. Plates of
                   γ′-phase are formed on the grain boundary of
                   ferrite, at the interface between inclusions and the
                   ferrite matrix, and in the ferrite matrix in close
                   succession with aging time. The size of the average
                   γ′-plate is about 10 μ in length, about 5 μ in
                   width and about 0.1 μ in thickness. The
                   precipitation of nitrogen proceeds by the increase in
                   the number of γ′-plates with aging time.},
