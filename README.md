# pcpsim

A collection of MATLAB/OCTAVE scripts to perform simulations of homogeneous
precipitation in a 2-phase alloy.

A system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) that describe the nucleation
and growth of precipitates and the solute balance in the alloy are solved using
the standard solver `ode15i`.

The scripts may be used for simulating precipitate evolution during heat-treatment processes.
